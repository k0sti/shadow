Living plan. Revise it as we learn. Do not treat this as a fixed contract.

## Scope

- Add the first app-facing sound API for runtime apps.
- First target: rooted Pixel runtime lane.
- MVP: play, pause, stop, and release one MP3-backed player from an app.
- Keep the app-facing API stable across host and Pixel even if the backend differs.
- Shipping preference order:
  Linux-native if it proves stable on the device, otherwise Android-native C++.
- JVM-backed playback is acceptable only as a demo/unblocker lane, not the intended shipped backend.
- Non-goals for v0: recording, mixing graphs, browser-compatible Web Audio, perfect AV sync, or ultra-low-latency synth input.

## Approach

- Keep sound below the existing OS API seam: apps call `@shadow/app-runtime-os`, not a renderer-specific hook.
- Add `Shadow.os.audio` beside `Shadow.os.nostr`.
- Keep audio off the render/dispatch JSON contract; use async OS ops and let the existing `renderIfDirty()` poll pick up UI state changes.
- Treat the rooted Pixel backend as a two-spike decision:
  1. quick falsifiable Linux-direct probe from the current GNU helper
  2. native Android/bionic bridge, expected to be the shipping path if the Linux probe is brittle
- Do not commit to a shipped JVM backend.
- Preferred shipped Pixel backend: a tiny Android-native C++ bridge that uses Android audio APIs from a bionic process.
- Preferred native stack: Oboe on top of AAudio where available.
- For compressed assets, keep decode separate from output:
  - simplest native MVP: decode MP3 in-process to PCM, then feed Oboe
  - platform-native growth path: `AMediaExtractor` / `AMediaCodec` decode to PCM, then feed Oboe/AAudio
- Temporary demo/unblocker path: framework `MediaPlayer` for local-file or URL-backed MP3 playback.
- Connect `shadow-runtime-host` to the chosen bridge over a narrow IPC seam. Prefer a local socket or stdio-like command protocol over coupling audio to the Blitz client.
- Start with one active player and file-backed sources. Add multi-player or SFX-specialized paths only after the single-track seam is proven.
- Add asset staging so runtime apps can ship audio files next to the bundled JS on host and Pixel.

## Milestones

- [ ] Backend decision proved on hardware.
  Compare Linux-direct playback against a native Android/bionic bridge during rooted takeover and choose the shipped path.
- [x] App-facing audio API agreed.
  Land a small handle-based `Shadow.os.audio` contract before writing platform code.
- [x] Host/mock backend.
  Add a mock or no-op backend so app code and host smokes can land before Pixel audio is fully wired.
- [ ] Pixel audio bridge MVP.
  Build the native Android/bionic bridge, point it at a staged MP3, and prove audible playback through the normal device route.
- [x] Runtime host extension.
  Add a `runtime-audio-host` crate/ops and inject `Shadow.os.audio` into `shadow-runtime-host`.
- [ ] Asset pipeline.
  Copy audio assets during app bundling and expose stable file URIs or manifest IDs.
- [ ] Smokes and operator recipes.
  Add host API smoke, visible runtime smoke, and rooted Pixel manual/automated sound proof.
- [ ] Productize.
  Add volume, loop, seek, focus/interruption policy, and decide whether tiny UI sounds need a second fast path.

## Near-Term Steps

- [x] Run the Linux-direct probe first.
  `just pixel-linux-audio-spike` now runs end-to-end on the rooted Pixel and produced audible output. The current narrow proof is synthesized PCM tone playback through ALSA `plughw:0,0` with a Pixel-specific `speaker-mm1` mixer route during takeover.
- [ ] Prove the native Android bridge shape on a real Pixel.
  During rooted takeover, play a known MP3 through a bionic-native helper from `adb shell` and confirm the speaker path still works.
- [ ] Pick packaging and IPC.
  Preferred shipped shape: `shadow-audio-bridge` native daemon plus local socket. Demo fallback: `app_process` with a tiny Java entrypoint.
- [ ] Lock the MVP API.
  Prefer `createPlayer`, `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `release`, and `getStatus` over raw PCM streaming for v0.
- [x] Add one demo app.
  Create `runtime/app-sound-smoke/app.tsx` with Play, Pause, Stop, Loop, and visible status/error state.
- [x] Add one operator command.
  Add a `just runtime-app-sound-smoke` host path and a `just pixel-runtime-app-sound-drm` rooted device path.

## Implementation Notes

- The current runtime seam is already the right insertion point:
  `@shadow/app-runtime-os` -> bundled JS helper -> `shadow-runtime-host` extension -> platform service.
- `runtime/app-runtime/shadow_runtime_os.js` is the obvious home for the JS-side audio wrapper and mock fallback.
- `rust/runtime-nostr-host` is the pattern to copy for a new `runtime-audio-host` crate.
- `scripts/runtime_prepare_app_bundle.ts` and `scripts/pixel_prepare_runtime_app_artifacts.sh` are the current staging seams for bundle-adjacent assets.
- The rooted Pixel takeover scripts stop display services, not audio services, so Android-owned playback should survive the current takeover model.
- The current helper is glibc/Linux, so a serious Android-native audio path likely means a second device-side process built against bionic and spoken to over IPC.
- Direct Linux audio from the GNU helper is still worth one quick spike, but it is not the default shipping bet: no desktop audio server, device-specific routing, and it bypasses Android audio policy/HAL behavior.
- The first Linux-direct spike stays intentionally narrow: synthesized PCM tone, ALSA device candidates discovered from `/proc/asound/pcm`, copied `share/alsa` and an optional `lib/alsa-lib` plugin dir into the GNU bundle, and JSON summary capture under a dedicated Pixel run dir.
- The GNU launcher for the audio spike must not `chroot`; the process needs the device's real `/dev/snd` and `/proc/asound` surfaces to stay visible.
- The probe must not count proxy or hostless PCM success as "sound works." On this device, the actual audible proof came from `MultiMedia1` / `plughw:0,0` after applying the speaker route controls, while `AFE-PROXY` accepted PCM without audible output.
- The first runtime audio slice should stay tone-backed. It proves `Shadow.os.audio` end-to-end without pretending file decode is solved; file or MP3-backed sources are the next seam after the tone helper is stable.
- The rooted Pixel runtime lane cannot stay `chroot`ed if it needs Linux-direct audio. The sound-specific launcher has to execute in the real device root so the runtime host and its helper can keep `/dev/snd` and `/proc/asound`.
- The safest regression boundary is a sound-only no-`chroot` launcher. Keep the existing runtime-app launcher behavior unchanged for non-audio apps until the broader Pixel runtime lane is revalidated on the real phone.
- `runtime-audio-host` now owns the first durable contract: `createPlayer`, `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `release`, and `getStatus`, with a memory backend on host and a `linux_spike` backend on the rooted Pixel lane.
- The current rooted Pixel proof is now app-level and audible: the sound demo auto-clicked `play`, `Shadow.os.audio` spawned `run-shadow-linux-audio-spike`, and the device speaker emitted the tone during the rooted runtime session.
- If we need a shipped native path, Android’s current guidance is to target Oboe or AAudio rather than new OpenSL ES designs.
- Start with file or URI playback, not PCM streaming. If we later need synthesis or latency-critical SFX, add a separate streaming/SFX API instead of overloading the MP3 path.
