# Deno / JS Runtime Plan

Living note. Revise it as we learn. Do not treat this as a fixed contract.

## Ground Rules

- Android is the current bootstrap host, not the target runtime.
- Aim at Linux-style payloads for the phone.
- Do not force `gnu` vs `musl` too early.
- Start below the full Deno CLI.

## Current Ladder

1. Done: package `rusty_v8` under Nix and prove host + GNU cross builds.
2. Done: tiny `rusty_v8` embedder.
   Eval JS, print result, no Deno yet.
3. Done: tiny `deno_core` embedder.
   Eval JS, file-backed ES modules, top-level `await`, host + GNU cross builds.
4. Done: first host/runtime protocol seam.
   Tiny async extension op from JS into Rust and back.
5. Done: first phone execution envelope.
   Rooted Android shell launches a GNU/Linux binary by pushing the loader plus the small glibc closure beside it.
6. Done: run the `deno_core` seam on the real phone.
7. Done: minimal `deno_runtime` smoke.
   Host-built snapshot, file-backed modules, `Deno.readTextFile`, timers, event loop, host + GNU cross builds, and rooted Pixel execution through the first GNU envelope.
8. Done: split app-model work into `todos/app-runtime.md`; keep this note on runtime substrate.
9. Done: load the first compiled Solid-universal app bundle through host `deno_core` and return a document payload from JS back to Rust.
10. Done: bundle the first app-runtime artifact into one local JS module so `deno_core` can stay file-backed while the build step still pulls Solid runtime code from npm.
11. Done: add a long-lived host session mode to the tiny `deno_core` helper so the visible Blitz host can render and dispatch events without embedding the JS runtime directly into the UI crate.
12. Done: reuse that same helper on the rooted Pixel by staging the bundled app JS beside a GNU-wrapped `deno-core-smoke` closure and pointing the static Blitz client at the wrapper script.
13. Done: prove the same host app/session contract on `deno_runtime`.
    The helper backend is now swappable on host without changing the Blitz-side session protocol.
14. Next: decide whether the first GNU envelope stays the runtime substrate long-term or whether we retarget toward a more self-contained payload.
15. Next: decide whether the app-runtime lane should stay on `deno_core` for now or promote to `deno_runtime` only once it needs features that justify the heavier runtime.
16. Later: if the app-runtime lane needs it, define the first repo-owned protocol above `deno_runtime` and evaluate swapping the current helper backend.

## Open Questions

- Can we keep using upstream `rusty_v8` archives for these first seams, or do we eventually need a repo-owned V8 build?
- When do we switch from the first GNU envelope to a more self-contained payload?
- Which minimum host ops does the app-runtime lane actually need first?
- Does the app-runtime lane still justify `deno_runtime`, or is `deno_core` enough longer than expected?
- What is the thinnest `deno_runtime`-only feature we would need before it beats the current `deno_core` helper in complexity tradeoffs?
